Misc tools I used for roblox:

alt_randomizer.luau - https://github.com/raphtalia/RbxFingerprint - Fingerprinting was a thing where if you didn't restart your pc/clock when you join a server on an alt, it can correlate the accounts,
this tool was made to anonymize & store all your alts so that the alts all had their own unique fingerprint
